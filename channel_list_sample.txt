# Sample file for channels to cahce.
# Save this file as channel_list.txt in project root folder and it will be picked automatically by the python script
#
# How to specify a channel:
# channel URL (eg lbry://@ScottManley#5) [, date/time in YYYY-MM-DD format to load]
# lines starting with a # are ignored

# Example:
# lbry://@ScottManley#5, 2021-05-01

# The lbry:// protocol bit can be skipped. Also, the date is optional (but it will cache the whole channel)
# @ScottManley#5
